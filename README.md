## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Real-Time Packet Capture** - Monitor live network traffic
- **ML-Powered Detection** - Uses `scikit-learn` for anomaly detection
- **Automated Response** - Instant blocking of malicious sources via a dynamic firewall
- **Modern GUI** - Intuitive interface with live charts

### ü§ñ Machine Learning Model
- **Isolation Forest** - Unsupervised anomaly detection to identify unusual traffic patterns.

### üîí Security Features
- DoS/DDoS attack detection (rate-based)
- Port scan identification
- SQL Injection and Directory Traversal detection
- Dynamic firewall rules
- IP reputation scoring (internal)
- Geographic threat tracking (mocked)

### üìä Advanced Tools
- Interactive packet analyzer
- Port scanner with service detection
- Threat intelligence dashboard
- Bandwidth monitoring
- Protocol-specific analysis (HTTP, DNS)
